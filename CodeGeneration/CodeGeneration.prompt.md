# Generation of a lexer using Mistral/pro

Using C# generate a lexer class.
- The lexer will recognize
    numbers,
    double-quote string,
    identifier,
    operators (+, -, *, /, =), and parentheses.
- The lexer should accept the following keyword EXECUTE and PRINT
- The lexer should accept nested block using the character '{' for start block 
and '}' for end block


- Write unit tests.


# Generation programming language runtime

Using C# version 7 ONLY and .NET Framework 4.8 syntax, generate a small JavaScript like interpreter.
Create a lexer class, a parser class and an interpreter class.
Use the concept of Abstract syntax tree.
The interpreter should support:
- operators (+, -, *, /, =) with parentheses.
- variables
- while loop
- for loop
- custom function
- print function to print to the console.

Write unit-tests as example.
